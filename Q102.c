//Write a Program to take a sorted array arr[] and an integer x as input, find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x and print it. This element is called the ceil of x. If such an element does not exist, print -1. Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, x, ans = -1;
    printf("Enter number of elements: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    int arr[n];
    printf("Enter sorted elements: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
    printf("Enter x: ");
    scanf("%d", &x);
    int low = 0, high = n - 1;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] >= x) {
            ans = mid;
            high = mid - 1;
        } else {
